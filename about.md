Reading fanatic.  

He likes to ride his bike, play in mud, and play board games.

Copies her big brother in pretty much everything.  Incredibly **_TWO_**, both in order and in age.

Being the middle child, she is part of "The Bigs" and "The Littles".

Spits up a lot, sleeps poorly, and makes a lot of wet diapers.  

What an awesome little guy! (Good thing he's **really** cute!)
