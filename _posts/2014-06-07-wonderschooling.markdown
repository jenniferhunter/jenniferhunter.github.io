We are homeschoolers.  It feels early to make this statement - after all, Peanut is just five.  If he were going to school, he'd be wrapping up his Junior Kindergarten year, and I know many families who passed on JK.  However, I've spent the past year explaining to people that "no, he's not in school" and "actually, we're homeschooling."  I've found that it sounds right and feels right.

Over the past several months we've started to dip our toes into the local homeschooling community.  I've read every homeschooling book at our library (and a couple bonus ones through interlibrary loans).  I enjoy homeschooling blogs and podcasts.  Some of the excitement over homeschooling can quickly turn to overwhelm.  How are we going to homeschool?  What will it look like to our family?  Sure, we're homeschoolers, but that term actually paints a much broader swath than you might think!

My research and reflection has led me to define my own terms.  I don't think this is unusual among homeschooling families.  Though many may fit in as "[Classical](http://www.homeschool.com/Approaches/Classical.asp)", "[Unschooling](http://www.homeschool.com/Approaches/unschooling.asp)", or "[Charlotte Mason](http://www.homeschool.com/Approaches/CharlotteMason.asp)", there is a category of homeschooling called  **[eclectic](http://eclectic-homeschool.com/why-eclectic-homeschooling/ "Why Eclectic Homeschooling?")** that leads me to believe we are not the only ones creating our own vision!  I asked myself why I want to homeschool and what the best outcome would be.  Like any parent, I'm searching for the best for my child - but I needed to figure out just what that should look like for us.

And so...we're **wonderschooling**!  In  the end, we hope to raise people who continue to find wonder in every day life.  My five year old delights in learning new things, and I intend to homeschool to keep it that way.  My two year old can barely wait to start her day - how wonderful if she could be the same at ten or at thirty?  Our homeschooling vision will be to nourish this sense of wonder; to create people who are excited by their world and their lives.
