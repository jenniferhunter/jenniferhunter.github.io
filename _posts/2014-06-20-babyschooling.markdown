The top concern that people raise when they learn that we are homeschooling is that of curriculum.  

Common questions include:
<ul> 
<li> "Does the school board provide curriculum?"
<li> "How do you know what to teach?"
<li> "Where do you buy curriculum?"
</ul>

My answer at this point has been that _we don't follow a curriculum_.

Peanut is just five, so would be in Junior Kindergarten which is not mandatory.  Even as he gets older though, our province does not have any specific regulations regarding homeschooling.  We're basically free to educate as we wish.  What this looks like at our home is _reading a lot of books_, baking together, playing games, playing outdoors, doing crafts, and _constantly_ answering our kids questions.  Our lives are full of activity and wonder and Peanut is learning _effortlessly_.

At least that's how it was until January.  In January our new baby arrived.  The months since Sprout arrived have been, understandably, crazy.  Some parents mention taking a few weeks from homeschooling to adjust to the new baby.  Five months in, we're still adjusting.  As a result, for several months we had limited outside time - this has changed since the warm weather arrived and we can easily sit in the yard.  We've done crafts just a couple times, we only recently started to bake again, and there just isn't as much time to do as much as we'd like.

Sometimes Peanut and Pico entertain themselves - and sometimes they fight, or get into things they shouldn't.

Sometimes they watch [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com) or play on [Starfall](http://www.starfall.com) for too long.  

Sprout doesn't nap alone, so his naps are on the go and often shortened by me trying to keep up with the others while holding a sleeping baby.
There has certainly not been any fixed curriculum we're following - no checklists to show our progress in meeting learning goals.

What has Peanut learned in this period?
He's learned that:
<ul>
<li>breastfeeding babies who are fed on demand will <i>nurse a lot</i>.
<li>it's perfectly okay to cuddle a baby while he sleeps and that <i>babies don't need to sleep through the night by some arbitrary age</i>.
<li>mama works hard taking care of the baby and <i>sometimes</i> needs to sit and rest (he has even learned to bring her a drink of water!).  
<li>dirty dishes and messy floors are okay, because <i>baby is more important than a clean house</i>.  
<li>slings and baby carriers are wonderful, since Mama and Daddy can play with him or take him to the park while <i>holding</i> the baby.  
</ul>

I'm thinking of this time as _Babyschooling_.  I like to imagine Peanut one day as my grown son, becoming a father himself.  I hope that he'll naturally become the parent he's seen growing up - a patient, present father who puts his relationship with his child as a priority.  If he never does become a father, I still believe that the lessons he's learned in watching us care for his brother will extend to help him in all his relationships.  When I think of this, I recognize that babyschooling has given him so much more than any curriculum could.
